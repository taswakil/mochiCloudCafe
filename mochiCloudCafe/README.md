# Mochi Cloud Cafe

This is a very cute bakery website that I built to practice React Router! It includes nested routes,, navLinks,, useNavigate,, URL parameters,, and useLoaderData. There isn't functionality for everything (such as the 'daily & weekly favs' menu on the home page),, I just wanted to hit those main concepts I just mentioned.  

I presented this project at the Design & Code Meetup (my 1st ever tech talk!) on April 16, 2025.
